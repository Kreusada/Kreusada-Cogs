This is the cog guide for the 'RPSLS' cog. This guide
contains the collection of commands which you can use in the cog.

Through this guide, ``[p]`` will always represent your prefix. Replace
``[p]`` with your own prefix when you use these commands in Discord.

    that you are up to date by running ``[p]cog update rpsls``.

Now, we can install RPSLS.

Once it's installed, it is not loaded by default. Load it by running the following
command:
