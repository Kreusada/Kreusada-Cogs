# Cogs for Red-DiscordBot authored by Kreusada

Hello, these are the third party cogs I created for Red-DiscordBot.

## Installation

Primarily, make sure you have `downloader` loaded.

```
[p]load downloader
```

Next, let's add my repository to your system.

```
[p]repo add kreusada https://github.com/Kreusada/Kreusada-Cogs
```

To install a cog, use this command, replacing `<cog>` with the name of the cog you wish to install:

```
[p]cog install kreusada <cog>
```

## Available Cogs List

Please see [here](https://github.com/Kreusada/Kreusada-Cogs/blob/master/cogs.csv) for the list of available cogs. Cogs get added and removed without notice.
