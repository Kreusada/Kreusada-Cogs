# Contributing to the Raffle Cog

I am hesitant to allow users to openly contribute towards this project.
The reason being is that the cog requires a lot of learning and understanding,
with the conditions, the commands, and the code itself. Please, even if you
are experienced at coding, open an issue, or speak to me in my support channel
instead (#support_kreusada-cogs).

Suggestions are always welcome, especially for new conditions. So again, feel
free to file an issue or speak to me in my support channel.

# What I will refuse to add

I will not be adding reaction-based conditions, or timers. Please do not
request for them. It is a command-based raffle cog, which focuses on conditions.
