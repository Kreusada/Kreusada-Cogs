This is the cog guide for the 'VoteChannel' cog. This guide
contains the collection of commands which you can use in the cog.

Through this guide, ``[p]`` will always represent your prefix. Replace
``[p]`` with your own prefix when you use these commands in Discord.

.. note::

    This guide was last updated for version 2.0.1. Ensure
    that you are up to date by running ``[p]cog update votechannel``.

    If there is something missing, or something that needs improving
    in this documentation, feel free to create an issue `here <https://github.com/Kreusada/Kreusada-Cogs/issues>`_.
