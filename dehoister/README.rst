-----
Usage
-----

Dehoister will protect your guild against users with hoisted usernames. Hoisted names are often used to
promote scams, hate speech, guilds, and other things which may come across as malicious. Or, its just your
average discord user going "I'm at the top of the member list look at me look at meeee!".

This cog will take action on any user, if their name starts with one of `these characters <https://github.com/Kreusada/Kreusada-Cogs/blob/f4e59c138e79604d327001a7b4f63bc156bf79ae/dehoister/dehoister.py#L18>`_.

They are the only characters that come above numbers and letters in ASCII, and if a user's name starts
with one of these, 90% of the time it will be because they want to be hoisted.

Features include 'scanning and cleaning' and auto-dehoisting, with lots of customization such as the nickname,
and modlog events.

**Syntax**

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]hoist explain auto

**Description**

Explain how auto-dehoist works.

To get started, use ``[p]hoist set toggle true``, which will enable this feature. Then, you can customize the nickname via ``[p]hoist set nickname``.
When new users join the guild, their nickname will automatically be changed to this configured nickname, if they have a hoisted character at the start of their name.
If your bot doesn't have permissions, this process will be cancelled, so make sure that your bot has access to nickname changing.

.. _dehoister-command-hoist-explain-scanclean:

"""""""""""""""""""""""
hoist explain scanclean
"""""""""""""""""""""""

**Syntax**

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]hoist explain scanclean

**Description**

Explain how scanning and cleaning works.

If users were able to bypass the auto dehoister, due to the bot being down, or it was toggled off, there are still tools you can use to
protect your guild against hoisted names. ``[p]hoist scan`` will return a full list of users who have hoisted nicknames or usernames.
``[p]hoist clean`` will change everyones nickname to the configured nickname if they have a hoisted username/nickname.

X users found:

user#0001:
- Their nickname (if applicable)

user#9999:
