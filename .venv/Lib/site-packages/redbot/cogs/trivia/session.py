        A list of tuples mapping questions (`str`) to answers (`list` of
        `str`).
    settings : `dict`
        Settings for the trivia session, with values for the following:
         - ``max_score`` (`int`)
         - ``delay`` (`float`)
         - ``timeout`` (`float`)

         - ``payout_multiplier`` (`float`)
    scores : `collections.Counter`
        A counter with the players as keys, and their scores as values. The
        players are of type `discord.Member`.
