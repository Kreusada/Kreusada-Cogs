contains the collection of commands which you can use in the cog.

Through this guide, ``[p]`` will always represent your prefix. Replace
``[p]`` with your own prefix when you use these commands in Discord.

    This guide was last updated for version 1.1.0. Ensure
    that you are up to date by running ``[p]cog update wordbase``.
