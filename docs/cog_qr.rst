This is the cog guide for the 'QR' cog. This guide
contains the collection of commands which you can use in the cog.

Through this guide, ``[p]`` will always represent your prefix. Replace
``[p]`` with your own prefix when you use these commands in Discord.

.. note::

    This guide was last updated for version 1.2.0. Ensure
    that you are up to date by running ``[p]cog update qr``.

    If there is something missing, or something that needs improving
    in this documentation, feel free to create an issue `here <https://github.com/Kreusada/Kreusada-Cogs/issues>`_.

    This documentation is auto-generated everytime this cog receives an update.

Commands

Here are all the commands included in this cog (1):

+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Command   | Help                                                                           |
+===========+================================================================================+
| ``[p]qr`` | Create a QR code from text.                                                    |
|           |                                                                                |
|           | When you scan this QR code, it will take you to google with the text query,    |
|           | or the website if you provide a website. That's essentially how QR codes work. |

Installation
------------

If you haven't added my repo before, lets add it first. We'll call it
"kreusada-cogs" here.

.. code-block::

    [p]repo add kreusada-cogs https://github.com/Kreusada/Kreusada-Cogs

Now, we can install QR.

.. code-block::

    [p]cog install kreusada-cogs qr

Once it's installed, it is not loaded by default. Load it by running the following
command:

.. code-block::

    [p]load qr
