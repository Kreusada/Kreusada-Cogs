This section of the documentation will give you an insight into some

in days is below the required amount. Provide this condition as a number, as a representation
of the account age requirement in **days**.

**Example usage**

.. code-block:: yaml

    account_age: 30

*************
allowed_users
*************

This condition will allow only certain individuals to join the raffle. This is essentially a raffle
whitelist. Provide users as a list, with their IDs.

**Example usage**

.. code-block:: yaml

***********
description
***********

This is the description for your raffle. It's completely optional, and will appear in various
commands such as ``[p]raffle info`` and ``[p]raffle list``. It's objective is to give your users
the best understanding of what your raffle is about.

**Example usage**

.. code-block:: yaml

    description: "This raffle contains not 1, but multiple prizes!"

***********
end_message
***********

This message is sent at the end of the raffle, when the winner is drawn from the pool.
There are various variables you can use to customize the output further.

**Variables**

* {raffle}
* {winner.name}
* {winner.mention}
* {winner.id}
* {winner.display_name}
* {winner.discriminator}
* {winner.name_and_discriminator}

***************
maximum_entries
***************

This conditions allows you to limit the number of entries that this raffle can take.
Once the limit is reached, no more users will be able to join, unless a previous user
was kicked, or they left themselves.

**Example usage**

.. code-block:: yaml

    maximum_entries: 10

* The use of spaces is forbidden. Use underscores instead.

This is the prompt for the bot when the a winner is picked for the raffle through
``[p]raffle draw``. Must be one of the following:

* ``end``: The raffle ends immediately after the first winner is picked.
* ``remove_winner``: The winner is removed from the raffle's entries, but the raffle continues.
* ``remove_and_prevent_winner``: The winner is removed from the raffle's entries, and is added to the prevented list.

***************

blacklist. Provide users as a list, with their IDs.

**Example usage**

    prevented_users: [123456780, 987654321, 2468013579]

***************
server_join_age
***************

The required length of time in days that the user must have been in the server for. This condition
is simular to the ``account_age`` condition, but it is instead how long the user has been in the
server for.

This condition must be a number, and it must be provided in days. This number cannot be higher
than the server's creation date.

.. warning::

    The ``join_age`` condition was deprecated for ``server_join_age`` in version 1.2.3.
    Please update to this version, using ``join_age`` is now unsupported and will not work.

**Example usage**
