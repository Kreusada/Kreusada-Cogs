Project Workflow
================

I like to add my issues and PRs to my project named 'Workflow',
it helps to keep track of everything I need to get through.

There are four sections:

* To do
* In progress
* Done
* Rejected/Infeasible

If your issue/PR is in the ``To do`` section, that means that I haven't
started looking at it.

If your issue/PR is in the ``In progress`` section, that means that I have started to
outline, test or develop the requested changes.

If your issue/PR is in the ``Done`` section, that means the requested changes have been implemented or merged!

If your issue/PR is in the ``Rejected/Infeasible`` section, that means I am not making changes.

Please avoid elaborating profusely on original issues/PRs with outlined changes. I would much prefer
it that you opened a new issue/PR with the changes you'd like.
